## Anti-Paywall Archive Link Providers

Main: `https://archive.is/`
Alternative 1: `https://12ft.io/`
Alternative 2: `archive.org`

Feel free to recommend more. Archive.is and Archive.org doesn't have all the links archived.

**Make the world a better place: **When you click on the `archive.is` URL. If there are no pre-existing archives available, then please click on `archive this url` as this will help other users to see an archived link. Kinda like `BE KIND REWIND`.

## Paywall List

The paywall list is taken from the following URL. At first, I was mindfully fetching the list, but then I just manually inserted the list, way simpler this way.

**If you wish to update the paywall list, feel free to send a pull request.**
